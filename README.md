### Description

This is a program that i wrote to show my parents that i could make money on the market. It really came to be quite a nice program. It gives you $2500 to spend in stocks, its all real-time and it even costs $8 to trade like E*trade etc. Please let me know if you find any bugs and i will help you fix them and/or fix them myself.
 
### More Info
 
Just the stock you want to purchase.

Just be careful of what you touch, cause i trained myself from books so the coding is a lil confusing. Its 1/24 11:57 and i am uploading this again... this time with real-time trading. Didnt realize that the other was delayed... sorry for any inconvienience. Quotes are from yahoo. I got most of the bugs now... and thats about it. Have Fun!

Prices, changes etc.

Sometimes just gives STRANGE errors, like really big numbers etc.
